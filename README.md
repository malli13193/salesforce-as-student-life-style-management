# Student Attendance Tracking System on Salesforce

## Project Overview
This project is a **Salesforce-based Student Attendance Tracking System** designed to help educational institutions manage attendance efficiently. The system allows teachers to track student attendance, generate real-time reports, and monitor attendance trends through cloud-based solutions, leveraging Salesforce’s powerful platform.

## Key Features

### Student Profiles
- Store basic student details (name, ID, grade, contact details, etc.).
- Maintain attendance history, including dates of absence and presence.

### Attendance Tracking
- Teachers can take attendance directly via Salesforce on desktops, tablets, or mobile devices.
- Mark students as present, absent, late, or excused.
- Automated attendance data entry via integration with physical devices (biometric systems, RFID scanners).

### Dashboard and Reports
- Real-time dashboards displaying attendance statistics at the individual, class, or school level.
- Customizable reports showing attendance trends over time to enable proactive actions.

### Automated Alerts & Notifications
- Automatic alerts sent to parents or guardians when a student is absent without prior notice.
- Push notifications for teachers reminding them to take attendance or report attendance irregularities.

### Student and Teacher Portals
- **Student Portal**: View attendance history, apply for leaves, and track performance.
- **Teacher Portal**: Manage attendance records, view class statistics, and upload attendance in bulk.

### Leave Requests and Approval
- Students can request leaves via the portal, which teachers/administrators can approve or reject.
- Track leave requests and reasons for absence to better understand student behavior.

### Data Integration
- Integrate with existing systems like Student Information Systems (SIS) or Learning Management Systems (LMS).
- Store attendance data securely in the cloud for scalability and easy access.

### Analytics & Insights
- Predict absenteeism using Salesforce's AI tools.
- Insights to monitor attendance’s impact on academic performance and student lifestyle.

## Development Steps

1. **Requirement Gathering**: Identify the institution’s needs and prioritize features through input from teachers, administrators, and students.
2. **Salesforce Setup & Configuration**: Set up Salesforce Education Cloud or Salesforce Platform. Create custom objects such as **Student**, **Attendance Record**, and **Leave Request**.
3. **Custom Object Design**:
   - **Student Object**: Store ID, name, class, contact info, etc.
   - **Attendance Record Object**: Capture date, attendance status, reason for absence, etc.
   - **Leave Request Object**: Track and manage leave requests.
4. **User Interface Development**: Design **Lightning Components** or **Visualforce Pages** for attendance entry and leave management. Implement portals for teachers and students using Salesforce Experience Cloud.
5. **Automation**: Automate alerts, notifications, and attendance summaries using **Process Builder** or **Flow Builder**. Schedule jobs for daily attendance reports to administrators.
6. **Reports & Dashboards**: Create dashboards to visualize trends, such as class-wise or daily attendance rates. Customizable reports for administrators to track attendance at multiple levels.
7. **Testing & QA**: Perform testing to ensure requirements are met and verify data accuracy.
8. **Deployment & Training**: Deploy to the live Salesforce environment. Conduct user training for teachers and administrators.
9. **Post-Launch Support**: Provide ongoing support, implement feedback, and fix any bugs.
